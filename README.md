# Description

Welcome to the repo for the Bioc2021 workshop on `recountmethylation`! Here, you can find key learning resources, including the presentation slides and code, a `recountmethylation` cheatsheet, and a helpful wiki that links to tutorials, Illumina's platform documentation, and key related Bioconductor libraries.

# Resources

* [Workshop recording]()(This will link to the pre-recorded lecture video once it's uploaded!)

* [Presentation slides](https://github.com/metamaden/recountmethylation_bioc2021/blob/main/workshop_materials/bioc2021_deck.pptx) -- Slides from the Bioc2021 workshop presentation.

* [Presentation code](https://github.com/metamaden/recountmethylation_bioc2021/tree/main/workshop_materials) -- Scripts to reproduce the workshop presentation code examples. You can follow along with these scripts during the code break sections of the presentation.
