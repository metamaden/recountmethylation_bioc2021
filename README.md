# recountmethylation_bioc2021

Welcome to the repo for the [Bioc2021 workshop on `recountmethylation`](https://bioc2021.bioconductor.org/posts/paper106/). Here, you can find learning materials, including a [cheet sheet](https://github.com/metamaden/recountmethylation_bioc2021/tree/main/cheetsheet) and the [workshop lecture code](https://github.com/metamaden/recountmethylation_bioc2021/tree/main/workshop_code). This repo's [wiki](https://github.com/metamaden/recountmethylation_bioc2021/wiki) compiles links to many of the libraries used by `recountmethylation` to compile, harmonize, and analyze public. DNAm array data.
